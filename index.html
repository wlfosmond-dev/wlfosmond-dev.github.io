        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical) student at Memorial University of Newfoundland (Class of 2029).
            I enjoy applying hands-on problem solving to real projects, from programming to design and equipment setup.
            Outside of academics, I have a strong background in gymnastics and powerlifting, which has given me discipline,
            focus, and experience working as part of a team.

            <p>
                Created a video game in Python integrated with an Arduino board and attachments.
                Player voice levels were used as input to trigger in-game actions, combining software
                and hardware in an interactive way.
